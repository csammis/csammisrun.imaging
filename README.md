## History ##

I originally wrote this in 2009 as part of a project to extract features from scanned pages of an artistic manuscript: the [Codex Seraphinianus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Seraphinianus). Later that year the author of the book, Luigi Serafini, stated that the writing in the book doesn't have any specific meaning (it's [asemic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing), which is neat) so extracting text and applying natural language learning techniques wasn't going to be successful. Oh well! Writing the IP code was an interesting experience.
